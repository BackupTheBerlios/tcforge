Subtitler -0.6.4.2

Subtitler 'filter' to be used with transcode
I do not like the name 'filter' it is scientifically incorrect,
Subtitler does not filter (out) anything, it ADDS data (text).
'plugin' would be better perhaps.

This is Linux software.
released under the GPL.

If anything does not work, it is because I changed a 100 things,
since I am changing things all the time, have a look at obvious things,
or mail me.
Subtitler has already made many hours of subtitled DivX movies.
This distribution is just a hand made copy of some files in my transcode
directory.

Test:
The script 'test' uses test.c and tests for 'forgotten variables and
functions, which would cause the module load mysteriously to fail.

Subtitler looks by default at /root/.subtitles/font/font.desc.
Copy mp-arial-iso-8859-1.zip there, unzip it, select a fontsize (28 is good),
and copy font.desc and the .raw files to /root/.subtitles/font/.

Also your subtitle file should by default be in /root/.subtitles/ ,
in .ppml (xste)- or new-timed.ssa (substation alpha) format.

Works perfectly though, reformat, center text.
Many things defined in filter_subtitler.c etc with defines.

Copy the source .h and .c files to
/transcode/transcode-0.6.0pre1/filter/subtitler/

Type 
automake
in transcode/transcode-0.6.0pre1/, that will create the Makefile.in
then type
configure
in transcode/transcode-0.6.0pre1/, that will create the Makefile
Then
make install

Make a directory /root/.subtitles/
and
/root/.subtitles/font/
Unzip the font file in /root/.subtitles/font.

copy demo.ppml, rose.ppm and sun.ppm (included here) to /root/.subtitles/
or if elsewhere change the path in the example -J below, and in the object
definitions at the start of demo.ppml.

This version ONLY works with transcode-0.6 as the transcode API has changed.


Call subtitler from transcode like this (see CHANGES for an example):
-V \
-J subtitler="subtitle_file=/root/.subtitles/demo.ppml color_depth=32"

Only 720x576, 352x288, and 32 bits X tested this version in YUV 420
(-V option). 

Try uncommenting some things in the demo.ppml.

NOTE:
ONLY if you have the ImageMagick package installed, you can try xsize, ysize,
dxsize, dysize on pictures and movies.
Subtitler uses the 'mogrify' program from the ImageMagick distribution
for resizing.

There are other experiments of mine in the subtitler code, one removes white
stripes from Umatic tapes (drop outs) by replacing these with data from a
previous frame...
None of that code is finished, so ....


Stability:
This thing has been running for 24 hours several days, alas without the X11
routines I added today, .. should work OK.
