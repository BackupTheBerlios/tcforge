PROBLEMS/BUGS

(also read docs/OPTIMIZERS)
-------------------
General/
- clean up the YV12 vs I420 and RGB24 vs. BGR24 mess.

filter/
  filter_tc_video is broken for RGB mode

tools/
  The avi* utils have problems with some avifiles -- fixed?
  opendml AVIs do not work.

src/
  Make the order of execution of all the internal processing routines
  configureable (from a mail)
  As for the order of command line arguments. I have to say I
  don't like tools where ./foo -a -b is different than
  ./foo -b -a. Since I consider the wish for changing order of
  execution in video_trans.c a very advanced feature it might be
  feasible to add an option --internal_transforms STRING where
  string defaults to "jIXBZYrzlkKGC" (the pre-defined order) but
  allows to be overwritten. This is not easy to do (and may
  not even be the best solution) but I think if done correctly
  this option will give you all the freedom you want. Hmm, is the
  default order actually "jIXBZYrzlkKGC"? need to check that.

Slow filters and 30+ buffers and --nav_seek and -c:
 the time to sleep may be too short the import module will start over again,
 before the export is finished

import/
 - fix AC3 Pass-through for PSU mode.

cluster_mode+PSU
 - make these modes go a little better together
 11:39 <GigaStorm> also wie gesagt, wenn man genau nach den examples geht, d.h. 
                   nach cluster mode plus rippen einer 16:9 pal dvd, macht er 
		   nur psu0

2pass/
 - internal 2pass mode

 - transcode --detect modus
   choose and save tcscan information, etc
