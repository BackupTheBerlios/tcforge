HOW TO COMPILE:
---------------

Transcode compiles even if you have no additional libs installed. You do
not *need* to have a "yes" on every configure check. Transcode comes
with the most important libs included. That is libmpeg2 for decoding
MPEG-2 files, libdvdread for reading DVDs and libavcodec for decoding
and encoding MPEG-4 (DivX) video (use -x ffmpeg as import module).

Its recommended, that you have a recent nasm installed (>=0.98.35) if
you are on an x86 based platform. A recent version of lame is a good
thing to have installed, too.


./configure --help 
./configure && make all
make install

Set --with-mod-path=DIR  where import/export modules loadable at runtime
should go. Default is "${prefix}/lib/transcode".

If your libraries/packages are not installed in standard places, use the following options:

----
lame
----

If you have a local copy of lame (you need at least v3.89), support
will be configured automatically. lame v3.88 will not compile. 
As of version 0.3.0, libmp3lame v3.87 is included and will be compiled
and used as a fallback.

  --with-lame-includes=PFX  prefix where LAME includes are installed (optional)
  --with-lame-libs=PFX      prefix where LAME libs are installed (optional)

-----
libdv
-----

use the following options, if you libdv is not installed in the default:

location
  --with-dv-includes=PFX    prefix where local libdv includes are installed (optional)
  --with-dv-libs=PFX        prefix where local libdv libs are installed (optional)

--------
libmpeg3
--------

use the following options, if you libmpeg3 is not installed in the default:

  --with-libmpeg3-includes=PFX    prefix where local libmpeg3 includes are installed (optional)
  --with-libmpeg3-libs=PFX        prefix where local libmpeg3 libs are installed (optional)


-------
avifile
-------

You need avifile-0.6 or later to build the "af6" generic interface. 

  --with-avifile-exec-prefix=PFX  prefix where avifile-config is installed 
 
use
  --with-avifile-mods=no 
if you have problems compiling with avifile support.


WHAT GET'S INSTALLED:
---------------------

binary tools into ${prefix}/bin/  
transcode, 
tccat, tcdemux, tcextract, tcdecode, tcscan, tcprobe, tcmplex,
avimerge, avisplit, avifix, avisync, tcxmlcheck, tcmodinfo

shared library modules into ${prefix}/lib/transcode 
import_*.so,la, export_*.so,la, filter_*.so,la

Use `tcmodinfo -p' to find out the modpath of your transcode installation

man pages into ${prefix}/share/man/man1
