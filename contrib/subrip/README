1) What is this package for?
============================

This package extracts DVD subtitles from a subtitle stream and
converts it to pgm or ppm images or into VobSub format.  The main
purpose is to provide the required input to OCR software to convert
the subtitle images into ASCII text. Please note that the conversion
into ASCII is not part of this package but requires an OCR program
like gocr.


2) Installation
===============
Please download a current version from
http://subtitleripper.sourceforge.net/
and read the instructions there.
